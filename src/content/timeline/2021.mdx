# The ins and outs of working in a fully remote team 🏡

At [Immfly](https://immfly.com) I worked remotely from the beginning, which was a challenge for me as I work better when connecting with my teammates. I learned the importance of seeing each other, the informal conversations and meeting IRL.

# Being disconnected to the users 👥

Because my team was working in an external product, we had very little to say in its development. Also, the particularities of the industry made it really difficult to see the result of our work in the hands of the users. I felt very disconnected from them and far from being a product engineer.

# Learn to say, "This is not for me" 🙅‍♂️

After just seven months, I decided to leave [Immfly](https://immfly.com). I enjoy when being in a product-centric team where I can participate in its development end to end. I am not just a developer who codes some predefined tasks, this was not for me.

# Disconnect, recharge and reflect 🧘‍♂️

I reflect a lot when I need to take big decisions, and seeing that my last one career one was a fail hit hard on me. I needed time to think what should be my next path.

# New chapter, I join [Gigapipe!](https://gigapipe.com/) ✨

After the summer I started working at Gigapipe an early stage start-up in the big data field. There were a lot of challenges ahead, new concepts and technologies to learn about, and a small founding team to growth alongside. This could be my path to becoming a senior engineer.
