# 🚀 Learned to keep shipping

With the clock ticking and no MVP into production, I learned the importance to deliver fast and with short iteration cycles. Also, how a key factor is to have metrics to understand what your users do and want.

# 🤠 Wore multiple hats and assumed several roles

As a developer in an early stage start-up, your job is not just to write code. You need to assume new roles: helping in the team building process, defining a work system and implementing agile methodologies, leading technical decisions thinking in the DX and speed for now and the scalability in the future, etc.

# 🔥 Burned it if it didn’t work

During the summer, the company decided to pivot, and we basically throw away the MVP we have just finished. It was time to refine a new product, design it, architect it and start building it fast.

# 👨‍💻 Stepped up to the next step in my career

The work during the latest months, and the job mentoring and leading the team, helped me realize that I was ready to step-up. I could consider myself a senior engineer.
