# 🏠 Embraced remote life

Before Covid-19 I almost never worked remotely but now we had to learn how to keep working together as a fully distributed team.

# 🚀 Shipped a brand new site during the pandemic

Apart from working remotely we also launched the new application for [xceed.me](https://xceed.me) during the lockdown.

# 🛫 Joined [Immfly](https://www.linkedin.com/company/immfly)

At the end of the year, I started looking for a new chapter in my career. A different path to keep growing and trying different roles, and also new challenges to never stop learning.
