# Launched my first PWA build with React ([Esplaiada18](https://github.com/oriolcastro/esplaiada18)) ‚öõÔ∏èüöÄ

Until this point, all the projects I developed were basic WordPress sites or simple experiments. This was my first product launch of a React app used by thousands of users.

# Launched [okstudio.tech](https://github.com/oriolcastro/okstudio.tech) ‚ú®

If I wanted to be successful I needed a place to showcase what I could do and the work I had already done for others. This is why I rebrand my freelance work and launched a brand new site.

# Started the 6by6challenge ‚öóÔ∏è

This challenge consisted to design, develop, and deploy a web application each month for 6 months. It started in [december](https://github.com/oriolcastro/6by6challenge-december) but only lasted until [january](https://github.com/oriolcastro/6by6challenge-january) 2019 because I get hired!
