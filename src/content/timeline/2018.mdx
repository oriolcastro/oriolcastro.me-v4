# ⚛️🚀 Launched my first PWA built with React ([Esplaiada18](https://github.com/oriolcastro/esplaiada18))

Until this point, all the projects I had developed were basic WordPress sites or simple experiments. This was my first product launch of a React app used by thousands of users.

# ✨ Launched [okstudio.tech](https://github.com/oriolcastro/okstudio.tech)

If I wanted to be successful, I needed a place to showcase what I could do and the work I had already done for others. That’s why I rebranded my freelance work and launched a brand-new site.

# ⚗️ Started the [6by6challenge](https://github.com/oriolcastro/6by6challenge-december)

This challenge consisted of designing, developing, and deploying a web application each month for six months. It started in [December](https://github.com/oriolcastro/6by6challenge-december) but only lasted until [January](https://github.com/oriolcastro/6by6challenge-january) 2019 because I got hired!
