# 🔮 Navigated legacy code and a path to the future

Working with complex, outdated codebases is challenging, especially when working with new frameworks. I quickly adapted to Vue and Nuxt, transforming legacy systems and strategically positioning our tech baseline for future growth.

# 📈 Led product development closer to business than ever before

In an early-stage startup pre-Product Market Fit, I took the lead on Product Development. I focused on user-centric design, exploring [product discovery techniques](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/08/product-discovery), and identifying critical user pains. I learned how to align behind business objectives and following relentlessly our north star.

# 💎 Focused on bringing value, not just writing code

Technical decisions must always be measured by the value they deliver to users. While thinking in the future is crucial, premature optimization is a pitfall of any engineering culture. In a word where AI-enabled coding tools are becoming ubiquitous, it's crucial we understand what's our job about.

# 🛠️ Went from planning to shipping, from DB schemas to button colors

This year, I led the development of a new product from inception to launch. Working within a small, cross-functional team, I expanded my technological toolbox by adding [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and its ecosystem. My role transcended traditional front-end boundaries, encompassing full-stack development and strategic product design.

# 🔜 My Product Engineer mindset solidified and always ready to ship

Let's see what the future brings...
