# Leading product development being closer to business than ever before 📈

In an early-stage startup pre-Product Market Fit, I took the lead on Product Development. I focused on user-centric design, exploring [product discovery techniques](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/08/product-discovery), and identifying critical user pains. I learned how to align behind business objectives and following relentlessly our north star.

# Our job is to bring value, not to write code 💎

Technical decisions must always be measured by the value they deliver to users. While thinking in the future is crucial, premature optimization is a pitfall of any engineering culture. In a word where AI-enabled coding tools are becoming ubiquitous, it's crucial we understand what's our job about.

# From planning to shipping, from DB schemas to button colors 🛠️

This year, I led the development of a new product from inception to launch. Working within a small, cross-functional team, I expanded my technological toolbox by adding [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and its ecosystem. My role transcended traditional front-end boundaries, encompassing full-stack development and strategic product design.
