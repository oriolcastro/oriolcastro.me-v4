# Quit my part-time job as a maths and physics teacher 👨‍🏫

At the end of the year, I quit my job to go all-in and pursue my dream to become a software engineer.

# Developed an experimental PWA using [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer) 🧪

Learning by doing has always been my motto, and trying new technologies the best way to keep me motivated.

# Created my [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) account 📖

Codecademy helped me, in the beginning, to learn the basics of web programming in a fun and engaging way.

# Create my [Github](https://github.com/oriolcastro) account 👨‍💻

Having an online presence was very important, if I wanted to become a developer I should be where the community was.
