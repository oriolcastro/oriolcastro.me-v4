# 🎉 Took on my first freelance projects

The beginnings were always hard, and being completely new to this sector meant finding clients wasn’t easy. But I had a clear goal and vision, so I kept pushing forward.

# 💾 Used WordPress as my entry point

I started building most of my freelance projects in WordPress because of its approachability and because it fit well within my clients’ requirements.

# ⚛️ Discovered and learned React

Almost by accident, I came across [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), which led me to React. The declarative nature and the component-based approach got my attention, so I went back into learning mode.

# 💸 Balanced career development with day-to-day needs

With my limited experience, the few projects I received were not enough to support me financially, so I started a new part-time job.
