# Balancing career-development and daily-to-daily problems 💸

With my little experience, the few projects I received were not enough to support me economically so I started a new part-time job.

# Discover and learn React ⚛️

I almost by accident came across [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) which lead me to React. The declarative nature and the component-based approach got my attention so I went back to learning mode.

# WordPress as the entry point 💾

I started creating most of my freelance projects in WordPress because of its approachability and because it fitted well within the requirements of my clients.

# First free-lance projects 🎉

The beginnings are always hard and being completely new to this sector finding clients wasn't easy. But I had the goal and vision clear so I kept pushing forward.
