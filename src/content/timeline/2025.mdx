# Becoming a father changed everything 👶

In February I became a father. Welcoming Kaia into the world was (and still is) the biggest shift in my life. I spent the first two months fully immersed in learning how to care for her, supporting our new family routine, and enjoying a kind of presence I had never experienced before.

# A new professional chapter, I join [Genesy](https://www.genesy.ai) 🚀

Fatherhood also made me reflect deeply on what I wanted for the next stage of my career: impact, strong engineering culture, and a team I could grow with. In April, I joined Genesy, and it instantly felt like the right place to build.

# Shipping quality while keeping the pace ⚖️

At Genesy I focused on helping the team keep delivery speed without sacrificing quality. That meant strengthening the fundamentals: clarifying standards, improving reviews and ownership, and nudging decisions towards simple, maintainable solutions that we could iterate on confidently.

# Tech lead, hiring, and building the team 🧭

As the year progressed, I took more leadership responsibilities: contributing to hiring and becoming the tech lead of one of the squads. I loved the mix of deep technical work and the human side of building an effective team that ships.

# Growing into engineering management 👥

I also started taking on engineering manager responsibilities: having direct reports, conducting 1-to-1s, giving feedback, and participating in performance reviews. It pushed me to be more intentional about communication, expectations, and helping others grow while keeping our direction clear.

# Going all-in on an AI-native culture 🤖

By the end of the year I fully embraced an AI-native way of working, leveraging the tools available to move faster and still raise the bar on quality. It’s changed how I write, review, and ship code. It also made me excited again about just how much we can build.
